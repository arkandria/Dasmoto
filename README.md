Dasmoto CSS project for Codecademy

## Introduction

This project is one of the exercises provided for Codecademy students for HTML and CSS practice. I received a  brief with instructions  (https://content.codecademy.com/courses/freelance-1/unit-2/dasmotos-arts_redline.jpg) and the images of the project and was instructed to replicate the web page starting from scratch. Students are free to use the code they need as long as the project is completed according to specifications. At the end, the school provides a solution code for us to compare with our own. This project is my version of the task.

## Technologies

I used HTML and CSS in VSCODE, used GIT as version control.
